      <h1>The Bybit Contango Crusher: A Practical B1T.BOT Strategy for Exploiting Bitcoin Futures Term Structure</h1>
      <p>
        This article presents a detailed, actionable strategy for trading Bitcoin futures on the Bybit exchange using
        B1T.BOT, focusing on exploiting the phenomena of contango and backwardation in the futures term structure. By
        monitoring the price differences between futures contracts with different expiration dates and leveraging B1T.BOT's
        algorithmic execution, traders can potentially profit from these market inefficiencies.
      </p>

        <h2>Part 1: Understanding Contango and Backwardation in Bitcoin Futures</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin futures represent agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a set price on a specific date. The term structure of
          Bitcoin futures refers to the relationship between the prices of these contracts with different expiration dates.
        </p>
        <h3>1.1 Contango</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Contango occurs when futures contracts with later expiration dates are priced higher than those closer to expiration.</li>
          <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: This reflects market expectations of higher future spot prices and the costs involved in holding the underlying asset.</li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: If the June contract is priced at $60,000, September at $61,000, and December at $62,000, the market is in contango.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1.2 Backwardation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Backwardation occurs when futures contracts with later expiration dates are priced lower than nearer expiration contracts.</li>
          <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: This suggests higher demand for the underlying asset in the short term or expectations of lower prices in the future.</li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: If June is at $60,000, September at $59,000, and December at $58,000, the market is in backwardation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1.3 The Roll Yield</h3>
        <p>
          In a contango market, rolling a long position forward typically results in a loss. In a backwardation market, rolling
          a long position forward generally results in a profit.

        <p>
          This strategy aims to profit from the roll yield by taking positions that benefit from either contango or backwardation
          in the Bybit Bitcoin futures market.

        <h3>2.1 Setting up B1T.BOT for Bybit Futures Trading</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bybit API Keys:</strong> Create an account and generate API keys with trading permissions.</li>
          <li><strong>Connect B1T.BOT to Bybit:</strong> Enter your Bybit API key and secret key in the B1T.BOT interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Defining the Strategy Parameters in B1T.BOT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instruments:</strong> Select BTCUSD perpetual and at least two quarterly futures contracts.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Monitoring:</strong> Configure B1T.BOT to fetch prices and calculate spreads between contracts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.3 Specific Parameter Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contango Threshold:</strong> 0.5% - 1.5% annualized</li>
          <li><strong>Backwardation Threshold:</strong> -0.5% - -1.5% annualized</li>
          <li><strong>Position Sizing:</strong> 0.5% - 1% of account balance per trade</li>
          <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> 1x - 2x (start low)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Part 3: Risk Management: Protecting Your Capital</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Leverage</h3>
        <p>
          Start low and gradually increase leverage if comfortable. Resist using high leverage initially.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2 Position Sizing</h3>
        <p>
          Use a conservative position sizing approach. Limit open trades to avoid overexposure.
        </p>
        <h3>3.3 Stop-Losses</h3>
        <p>
          Use dynamic stop-losses or reduce position size instead to manage risk without getting stopped out prematurely.
        </p>
        <h3>3.4 Monitoring and Intervention</h3>
        <p>
          Regularly monitor positions and market conditions. Be prepared to intervene manually if necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>3.5 Backtesting and Paper Trading</h3>
        <p>
          Backtest the strategy with historical data and use paper trading to simulate without risking real money.
        </p>

          Use the formula to annualize the spread and configure B1T.BOT for real-time calculation.
        </p>
        <h3>4.2 Dynamic Thresholds</h3>
        <p>
          Use volatility-adjusted thresholds based on current market conditions to enhance the strategy's adaptability.
