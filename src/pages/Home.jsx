          Supply Shock Exhaustion and On-Chain Velocity: Identifying Inflection Points in Bitcoin's Scarcity Narrative with B1T.BOT
        </h1>

        {/* Introduction */}
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This article unveils a powerful strategy based on Supply Shock Exhaustion and On-Chain Velocity (SSEOCV), a deep dive into the cyclical nature of Bitcoin's supply shocks, 
          primarily driven by halving events, and their interplay with the velocity of Bitcoin movement on the blockchain. By analyzing the diminishing impact of successive halvings, 
          identifying periods of supply absorption by long-term holders, and correlating these factors with on-chain velocity, we can anticipate potential inflection points in Bitcoin's 
          price trajectory. B1T.BOT, with its on-chain data processing, statistical analysis, and algorithmic trading capabilities, is uniquely positioned to implement SSEOCV strategies, 
          providing traders with a fundamentally-driven edge in today's Bitcoin market.

          <p className="mt-2">
            Bitcoin's halvings, which reduce the rate of new supply creation, have historically been associated with significant bull runs. However, the impact of each successive 
            halving is likely to diminish as the Bitcoin supply grows and the reduction in new supply becomes proportionally smaller.

            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold text-cyan-300">The Halving Cycle and its Impact:</span> Every 210,000 blocks (~4 years), Bitcoin's block reward is halved, creating a 
              supply shock that historically leads to price increases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold text-cyan-300">The Law of Diminishing Returns:</span> As Bitcoin's total supply grows, each halving represents a smaller percentage reduction, 
              making future halvings less impactful.

            SSEOCV involves analyzing the interplay between Bitcoin's halving cycles, long-term holder behavior, and on-chain velocity to identify when a supply shock has been fully absorbed
