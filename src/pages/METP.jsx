            <h2>Part 1: The Miner's Dilemma: Profitability, Hashrate, and the Halving</h2>
    
            <h3>1.1 The Economics of Bitcoin Mining</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Revenue Streams:</strong> Miners earn from the block subsidy (newly minted Bitcoins) and transaction fees.</li>
              <li><strong>Operational Costs:</strong> Mining involves significant operational costs, including electricity, hardware (ASICs), cooling, and maintenance.</li>
              <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Profitability is determined by the difference between revenue and operational costs.</li>
              <li><strong>Hashrate as a Measure of Investment:</strong> Hashrate indicates the level of investment in mining infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>1.2 The Impact of the Halving</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reduced Block Subsidy:</strong> The block subsidy is halved approximately every four years.</li>
              <li><strong>Increased Fee Dependency:</strong> Miners rely more on transaction fees post-halving.</li>
              <li><strong>Potential Miner Capitulation:</strong> If Bitcoin's price doesn't rise sufficiently, less efficient miners may exit, leading to reduced hashrate.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>1.3 The Pre-Halving Shakeout Phenomenon</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Miner Uncertainty:</strong> Miners face uncertainty about future profitability.</li>
              <li><strong>Increased Selling Pressure:</strong> Less efficient miners might sell holdings to cover costs.</li>
              <li><strong>Market Anticipation:</strong> Traders anticipate selling pressure, leading to volatility.</li>
              <li><strong>Opportunity for Accumulation:</strong> The pre-halving shakeout presents a chance to acquire Bitcoin at lower prices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.1 Monitoring Miner Revenue and Profitability</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Track on-chain data to monitor miner revenue and profitability.</li>
              <li>Estimate miner cost basis by considering factors like electricity prices and hardware efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>2.2 Tracking Hashrate Fluctuations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Monitor hashrate volatility to identify potential miner stress.</li>
              <li>Analyze the relationship between hashrate and price for pre-halving shakeout signals.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>2.3 Analyzing Fee Dependency</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Track the percentage of miner revenue from transaction fees.</li>
              <li>Monitor the fee market for high/low fee volatility periods.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>2.4 MEPHS-Based Trading Signals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify miner capitulation signals to generate buy alerts.</li>
              <li>Identify pre-halving accumulation windows based on historical patterns.</li>
              <li>Trigger alerts for fee dependency thresholds to adjust strategies accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
