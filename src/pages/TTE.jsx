          <li><strong>Strategic Focus:</strong> Identifying periods of miner stress, potential capitulation events, and pre-halving accumulation opportunities continues to be a primary objective.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Sentiment Analysis: Gauging Market Psychology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Emotional Overlay:</strong> Sentiment analysis adds a layer of psychological insight, helping to understand the emotional state of the market and anticipate potential shifts in investor behavior.</li>

        <h3>1.3 On-Chain Demographics: Understanding Investor Cohorts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Behavioral Insights:</strong> On-chain demographic analysis provides insights into the behavior of different investor cohorts, such as whales, long-term holders, and new entrants.</li>
          <li><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> Metrics like address growth, hodler net position change, exchange inflows/outflows, and coin age distribution can be tracked to gather insights.</li>
          <li><strong>Demographic Signals:</strong> Signals like whale accumulation, long-term holder distribution, and new entrant inflows can be used to generate trading signals.</li>
